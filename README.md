## UCSC Dining Menu

A better and faster solution for UCSC Dining Hall Menu lookup.

### Why

I am tired of slow and clunky [UCSC dining menu website](https://nutrition.sa.ucsc.edu/location.aspx), so I create [a better one](https://dining.projects.napatsc.com) (I guess).

### Workflows

A static Next.js page is generated every midnight (implementing)
  - scraping every dining halls' menus from [the website](https://nutrition.sa.ucsc.edu/location.aspx)
  - generating a page based on the menu
